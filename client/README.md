# Furniture store

This project I'm the most proud of for a variety of reasons.
1. It was my first project that I've converted into html/scss/ts from a Figma 
   design.
2. It was a challenge for me even though I'v been doing this for a while now.
3. When I had issues I solved them in record time.
4. This is the first project that I used TypeScript on and for some reason I
   noticed that codekit doesn't complain as much when I use typescript

### Deployment instructions:
I choose GitHub Pages to host this project for a few reasons:
1. It's free
2. It's easy to use
3. It's easy to setup and configure
4. It's easy to deploy
5. It's easy to maintain
6. It's easy to update
7. It's easy to rollback if necessary

You may use any hosting service that you like. I've used 
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or your own custom domain

## Running the tests
The reason that I choose to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). is because
it's a great tool for testing and it's easy to use. I've used it before and I
really like it. I've used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) before and I like it too
but I think the best testing framework is [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
